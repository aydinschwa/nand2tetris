#Project 7: VM 1: Stack Arithmetic

From the nand2tetris website:


Background:

Java (or C#) compilers generate code written in an intermediate language called bytecode (or IL). This code is designed to run on a virtual machine architecture like the JVM (or CLR). One way to implement such VM programs is to translate them further into lower-level programs written in the machine language of some concrete (rather than virtual) host computer. In projects 7 and 8 we build such a VM translator, designed to translate programs written in the VM language into programs written in the Hack assembly language. The VM language, abstraction, and translation process are described in chapters 7 and 8 of the book. For the purpose of this project, chapter 8 can be ignored.


Objective:

Build a basic VM translator, focusing on the implementation of the VM language's stack arithmetic and memory access commands. In Project 8, this basic translator will be extended into a full-scale VM translator.
