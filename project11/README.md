#Project 11: Compiler 1: Code Generation

From the nand2tetris website:


Background:

In this project we complete the construction of the Jack Compiler that we started building in the previous project.


Objective:

Extend the syntax analyzer built in project 10 into a full-scale Jack compiler. The output of the compiler should be VM code designed to run on the virtual machine implemented in projects 7-8. Use your compiler to compile all the Jack programs listed below. Make sure that each translated program executes according to its documentation.
