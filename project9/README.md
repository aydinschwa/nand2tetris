#Project 9: High-Level Programming

From the nand2tetris website:


Background:

This project introduces Jack - a simple, Java-like, object-based programming language. Before building a Jack compiler in projects 10-11, it makes sense to become familiar with the language itself. That's what we'll do in this project.


Objective:

Adopt or invent an application idea like a simple computer game or some other interactive program. Examples include Tetris, Snake, Space Invaders, Sokoban, Pong, etc. Your job is to implement this application in Jack.
