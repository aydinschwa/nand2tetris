#Project 5: Computer Architecture

From the nand2tetris website:


Background:

In previous projects we've built the computer's basic processing and storage devices (ALU and RAM, respectively). In this project we will put everything together, yielding the complete Hack Hardware Platform. The result will be a general-purpose computer that can run programs written in the Hack machine language.


Objective:

Complete the construction of the Hack CPU and the Hack hardware platform, leading up to the top-most Computer chip.
