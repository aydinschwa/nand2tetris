# nand2tetris
This is a repository of all the projects I've completed for the Nand to Tetris course on Coursera.

Projects 1-6 are from the first half of the course, which dealt constructing the hardware of the computer.

Projects 7-8 are from the second half of the course, and deal with the software hierarchy of the computer. I'm not done with this part yet, 
I just completed project 10 and realized I should probably upload these somewhere for safekeeping in case I mess anything up with project 11.
