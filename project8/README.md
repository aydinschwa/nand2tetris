#Project 8: VM 2: Program Control

From the nand2tetris website:


Background:

We continue building the VM translator - a program that translates programs written in the VM language into programs written in the Hack machine language. This is a respectable chunk of engineering, so we are doing it in two stages. Welcome to stage II.


Objective:

Extend the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, in project 7 we focused on handling the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.
