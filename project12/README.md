#Project 12: Compiler 1: The Operating System

From the nand2tetris website:


Background:

An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software services, designed to close gaps between the computer's hardware and application software. For example, if you use a high-level langauge to write a program that prompts the user to enter some data using the keyboard, the code generated by the compiler will include (among other things) calls to OS routines that handle keyboard inputs. Therefore, the OS can also be viewed as an extension of a high-level programming language. This is a rather simplistic view of operating systems, but it will suffice for our purpose.


Objective:

Implement the Jack OS specified in Chapter 12. In the process of building this OS, you will implement a modular collection of some beautiful algorithms in applied computer science. Thus, you will also be exposed, hands-on, to some cool computer science stuff.
